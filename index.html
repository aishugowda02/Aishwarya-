<h1>To My Love 🤞🤍</h1>
<p>
Happy Valentine's Day to the one who lives inside my heart every second...  
You may not always see how much I love you, but my silence carries storms of emotions.  
Even when I feel tired, even when I feel ignored, my heart still whispers only your name.  
You are not just a person in my life… you are the feeling I never want to lose.  
❤️😚🖇️

<h1>What I Never Say 💎🖇️</h1>
<p>
Sometimes I act strong, but the truth is… I just want you to care.  
I want you to fear losing me the way I fear losing you.  
I want you to hold me tighter when I become quiet.  
Not because I am weak… but because I love deeply.  
If I ever fight, it's not to leave… it's because I want us to stay.  
🌍🫂❤️

<h1>🤍😚</h1>
<p>
Just imagine two teddy bears hugging and kissing under the stars…  
That’s how I see us.  
Cute. Soft. Pure.  
Even when the world feels heavy, your presence feels like home.  
I don’t need perfect love… I just need your real love.  
💗🥺🖇️

<p>
Yes… this is for you, Mayur.  
You might think I will never leave.  
Maybe you feel too confident that I will always stay.  
But please understand… I stay not because I have no choice…  
I stay because I choose you every single day.  
I just need you to choose me too.  
That’s all my heart asks for.  
🫂

<h1> My Wish 🤞❤️🖇️</h1>
<p>
I don’t want a perfect fairytale.  
I don’t want big promises.  
I just want effort.  
Little messages. Little care. Little reassurance.  
Because even the strongest girl gets tired of being the only one fighting.  
Hold me, understand me, and love me softly.  
Let’s grow together, not apart.  
💍🤞🌜

<h1>Forever, If You Want 🥺❤️</h1>
<p>
If you are ready to love me with your whole heart…  
I am ready to give you mine completely.  
Not half. Not temporary.  
But something magical, something rare, something ours.  
Happy Valentine's Day, my love.  
🤍🖇️🫂🪐
